# arch

**Archived since usefulness was outlived after tools such as [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) were created and work better.**

**New configuration exists on [camper0008/conf](https://github.com/camper0008/conf).**

Helpful stuff I've written for installing, using and developing in Arch.

**Note: Most scripts are opinionated and based around my preferences, such as awesome.sh, and as such use my preferred themes and Danish locale and keyboard layout. It is up to you to edit these scripts to use your locales instead.**
